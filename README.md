**Design and develop IoT applications with edge analytical solutions including Azure IoT Edge**

## What is this book about?
Edge analytics brings intelligence to the sensory side of IoT applications. This is a comprehensive introduction for those who are new to edge analytics, that will have you up-to-speed in no time. You will learn to design modern edge analytics applications that take advantage of the processing power of single board computers and microcontrollers.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Discover the key concepts and architectures used with edge analytics
* Understand how to use long-distance communication protocols for edge analytics
* Deploy Microsoft Azure IoT Edge to a Raspberry Pi
* Create Node-RED dashboards with MQTT and Text to Speech (TTS)
* Use MicroPython for developing edge analytics apps
* Explore various machine learning techniques and discover how machine learning is related to edge analytics
* Use camera and vision recognition algorithms on the sensory side to design an edge analytics app
* Monitor and audit edge analytics apps

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
from time import sleep
import Adafruit_DHT
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
import json
host = 'demo.thingsboard.io'
access_token = '<<access token>>'
dht_sensor = Adafruit_DHT.DHT11
pin = 19

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you are a data analyst, data architect, or data scientist who is interested in learning and practicing advanced automated analytical computations, then this book is for you. You will also find this book useful if you’re looking to learn edge analytics from scratch. Basic knowledge of data analytics concepts is assumed to get the most out of this book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-10).
